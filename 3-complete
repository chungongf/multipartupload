//first let's check and see how the upload went and verify all expected results before attempting re-assembly
aws s3api list-parts --bucket my-target-bucket --key originalfile.xyz --upload-id 3d3d3d3d3

//you'll see an output that shows all the parts, tags, and sizes. verify these values against what you expect before continuing.

//run this command to complete your multipart upload
aws s3api complete-multipart-upload --multipart-upload file://y-json-file.json --bucket my-target-bucket --key originalfile.xyz --upload-id 3d3d3d3d3 

//assuming there were no issues with upload you will see output showing the tag, bucket, location, and key, indicating it was successful.
//you can prove it by checking the AWS directory, either via the web GUI or running CLI commands aws s3 ls and navigating to the appropriate bucket.
